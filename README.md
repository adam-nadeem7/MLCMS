# Machine Learning in Crowd Modeling and Simulation

The course is organized around six tasks on various topics in Machine Learning for Crowd Modeling and Simulation.

Modeling crowd dynamics: Modeling approaches, verification and validation
Simulation software: Introduction to the Vadere software, SIR models
Representation of data: Principal Component Analysis, Diffusion Maps, neural networks
Dynamical systems and bifurcation theory: Introduction to the theory and examples
Extracting dynamical systems from data: Function approximation, vector fields, time-delay embedding, (final projects)
Future directions of machine learning: Challenges in data science, masterâ€™s thesis topics, final projects. We did ours on Manifold Learning.
